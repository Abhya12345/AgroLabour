# AgroLabour
AgroLabour is a web-based system connecting farmers and contractors for efficient agricultural labor management. Farmers can post tenders and track status, while contractors accept and manage work. Built using Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL, it improves transparency, reduces manual effort, and ensures secure, organized workforce coordination.
